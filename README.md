###  **Bank Customer Action Prediction**

###  Author : Umidjon Sattorov, Machine Learning Engineer, successful graduate of the SkillBox platform, and student at Mohirdev platform

**Overview**

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer of a bank performs specific actions when they visit the bank's website. The project involved comprehensive data analysis to answer financial questions provided by the dataset and the development of an advanced machine learning model. After extensive training and evaluation of various algorithms, the final model achieved an impressive ROC AUC score of 0.9, demonstrating exceptional predictive performance.

**Features**

High Accuracy: Achieved a ROC AUC score of 0.9, indicating strong model performance.
Multiple Algorithms: Evaluated numerous machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
Customer Action Prediction: Predicts whether a customer performs specific actions on the bank's website based on various features.
Comprehensive Analysis: Includes detailed analysis and preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and model robustness.

**Technologies Used**

Python: Core programming language for data processing and model development.
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
FastAPI: Framework for creating APIs to deploy the model.

**Results**

The modelâ€™s high ROC AUC score of 0.9 highlights its ability to accurately predict customer actions, making it a valuable tool for understanding customer behavior and improving the bank's online services. The final model used in this project is an MLPClassifier with optimal hyperparameters. Here you can see the models performance on the server :
